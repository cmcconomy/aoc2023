# Day 02

Starting to get a little more familiar. I did use ChatGPT to look into a few common patterns: how to populate a list in a loop, how to populate a map in a loop, and how to compare the contents of two maps for equality. This is also the first time I use a `struct` - I think I will be using them alot.

I also used the ability to return an object by reference instead of value, but not really fully. I am making value copies

I've been enjoying building unit tests with the help of this unit test red/green tool in vscode!
